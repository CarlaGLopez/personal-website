<p> Nowadays, I am an NYU student with a major in <span class="lightblue"> Computer Science 
</span> and a minor in <span class="lightblue"> Web Programming and Applications </span>. 
I am not really sure what career or type of job I am looking for, but I am doing my best to 
explore my options. I will probably go to grad school for computer science. For now, I am 
just enjoying the ride.

<h1> INTERESTS </H1>
<p>
I love listening to MUSIC; honestly I don't know how I could have lived my 
life until now without it. When I was younger, my dad would always play disco music around
the house when I was younger, while my mom would work with the spanish jams in the kitchen.
I love listening to the radio in the car and discovering new songs/artists on Spotify. <br>

<p>I find languages fascinating. If I could speak all of them, that would be great. However
there are way too many languages for that to be possible. Here are some languages I speak 
though (in order of how well I speak each one):</p>

<span class="yellow"><ol>
  <li> English </li>
  <li> Spanish </li>
  <li> French </li>
  <li> Italian? (I learned it in elementary/middle school...and it's really close to spanish)</li> 
</ol> </span>
