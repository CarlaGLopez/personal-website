<h1> WHERE MY PARENTS FROM </h1>

<br>Both of my parents are from Ecuador. My parents' families knew each other. And so one day 
they met in Ecuador. My dad liked my mom so much, he would write her letters once he moved
to the United States. My mom was like "ehh he's pretty cool i guess" so she married him 
and moved to the U.S. to live with him. Out of their love, my twin sister (yep, we are 
fraternal) and I were made!

<h1> WHERE I'M FROM </h1> 
<p> 
I am a native New Yorker. I was born in Manhasset, Long Island in North Shore
University Hospital, now known as 
<a href="https://www.northwell.edu/about"> Northwell Health</a>. 
I have lived in different parts of Queens my whole life. My first home was in College 
Point, then I moved to Whitestone, and here I am back in College Point again.
<br>
I went to elementary school in Whitestone at Holy Trinity School. I went to high school 
in Fresh Meadows at St. Francis Preparatory.
