				<h2> Poké Childhood </h2>
				<p> As a 90s kid, I was obsessed with Pokemon (actually, I may still be 
				obsessed...). I would wake up early every Saturday to watch the Pokemon 
				anime on Channel 11. When I was younger, I also had little Pokemon 
				toys/figurines. I would play with them inside my big Barbie house. When I 
				was a little older, my brother gave me the video game Pokemon Sapphire, 
				and I enjoyed playing with it. </p>

				<h2> Poké Adulthood</h2>			
				<p> I still own all my Pokemon toys and the Pokemon Sapphire game. 
				Recently, I have been rewatching the Pokemon anime. I also play
				Pokemon Go, which is an mobile app that made my childhood dreams of 
				possibly being able to "catch 'em all" come true. I also have a collection
				of Pokemon plushes that is slowing starting to grow.

                <br>
                As you can see, my love for Pokemon won't seem to go away.
